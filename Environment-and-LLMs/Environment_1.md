# Notebook 1: The Course Environment

In this module, we'll introduce the course environment, covering setup requirements, workflows, and considerations.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn about the course environment through its creation and organization.
- Understand how to use the Jupyter Labs interface to interact with microservices.

## Questions To Think About:
1. What resources do you expect an environment for this course to have?
2. How would things differ if a microservice were running on another host?
3. What kinds of microservices are necessary for users, and which should run persistently?

## Welcome To Your Cloud Environment
This is a Jupyter Labs environment used for course content. It serves as a gateway to understanding microservices orchestration for applications centered around LLMs.
